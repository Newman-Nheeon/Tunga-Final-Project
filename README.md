Final assignment Tunga, Full stack    
The final assignment is to put together a personal movie database using all you have learned in previous 
classes. 
  
System requirements 
Your web application needs to:  
• Run on NodeJS 
• Use ExpressJS for REST API calls 
• Use any type of relational database, recommendation is MySQL running on XAMPP 
  
1. UI 
a. Your UI can be written in native HTML/CSS  
b. Extra points for native HTML / CSS if your web application is responsive 
c. You may optionally use different frontend frameworks like React/Vue3 instead of native 
HTML and TailwindCSS/Bootstrap instead of native CSS 
2. Functionality: 
a. Your web application should display your favorite top 10 movies 10 in a list 
o Genre 
o Plot 
o Release date 
o Your personal rating of the movie 
o A space to add your own notes of the movie 
b. It should have multiple inputs for:  
o Genre 
o Plot (using <textarea>) 
o Release date 
o Your personal rating of the movie 
o A space to add your own notes of the move 
c. When adding a movie, with attributes from above, it should be stored in the database of 
your choosing 
d. You should be able to remove and add new movies into the list. This should be done using 
JS(Axios) > ExpressJS > MySQL 
e. Extra points if you add a input tag and a button to search a specific movie by name 
f. Extra points if your list is sortable 
g. Extra points if you add the movie rating from an external website by using that websites API 
and compare it to your own - see http://www.omdbapi.com/#usage 
h. Extra points if you add a movie thumbnail in your list 
i. Extra points if your personal rating of the movie includes some type visual display of 
the rating, say 4/5 stars etc. 
3. Code comments 
a. You should comment your code and what it does 
4. Version control 
a. You should have a Git repo with the project. Your commits should include what has 
been done in that particular commit and match the changes in the code 
 
5. Instructions for installing the app 
a. Your app should be a NodeJS app and a simple npm install would install everything 
needed for the trainers to grade your project, but in case there are any other 
changes that you have made include a file with the instructions of what you have 
done
